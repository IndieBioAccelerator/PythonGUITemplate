=================

You will need Enthought's EPD distribution (32-bit, **not** 64-bit as it does not include Mayavi) which can be found [here](https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/installers/). You will need an academic license to access it for free.

Install via:

bash epd-7.3-2-rh5-x86.sh ('rh3' for older operating systems) or just use the .dmg image for OSX.
